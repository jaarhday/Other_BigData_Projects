# Feature Engineering Challenge

For this challenge, each team will develop the following from our data products;

- at least one easy feature (E.g., count of grocery stores in a Tract, median income in the county, number of cigarettes sold)

Remember, we are developing features that will support our machine-learning model. As we move forward, here are some key concepts and assumptions (things we assume we will do but may not complete this semester).

1. We are predicting the optimal number of products to purchase for stocking one week in the future.
2. Assumption: we will want to make updated predictions based on future data.
3. Assumption: we will have access to historical data to build our features for historical periods.

## Deliverables 


### Model Table

Your feature table should follow this general structure. We will build features at the store product level for Idaho (the US in the next step).
   
| UNIT of Analysis COLUMNS | F1   | ...   | Fn   |
| -----------------------  | ---- | ----  | ---- | 
|                          |      |       |      |

### Pseudocode Report

_One report submitted per team with a section for each feature with the team members' name that built it. At the front of your report, you should have a table name and a data dictionary that describes each feature. Each feature section should include the following._

1. an English paragraph describing the feature that includes pseudocode and references the tables and columns used to build the feature.
2. a code snippet that demonstrates the wrangling done and the chart created
3. a visualization of the feature as it relates to our target and
4. a display of the first five rows of your feature data table used in the display.
